Lets GET THE THROWING ON!!!!


-----------------------------
Practice Forms Need to be added -
a member can post a practice form which says
ex. practice at 4 .
So it doesn't have a description.
 It will also have a checkbox that says 'attending'
 where users will click it if they are attending that practice
------------------------------
Also i will add a follow button on users profile
that will notify all followers when that user posts
